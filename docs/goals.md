# Goals & Philosophy

This document outlines the goals, principles, and philosophy behind this dotfiles system, inspired by Omarchy's minimal approach while adding modern development workflow capabilities.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Omarchy-Inspired Minimalism

**Goal**: Extract and adapt the best components from Omarchy while maintaining its core philosophy of simplicity and focus.

**Implementation**:
- **Neovim**: Ultra-minimal config (4 files) with transparency, following Omarchy's exact approach
- **Shell**: Preserve Omarchy's aliases and functions, adapted from bash to zsh
- **Starship**: Minimal prompt as default, with optional full-featured variant
- **Trust defaults**: Let tools like LazyVim provide the functionality, minimal customization

**Why**: Omarchy demonstrates that simple, focused configurations are more maintainable and performant than complex setups.

### 2. Modern Development Workflow

**Goal**: Support contemporary development practices with directory-based environments, secrets management, and team collaboration.

**Implementation**:
- **Direnv**: Project-specific environment management
- **Git directory switching**: Automatic work/personal identity switching
- **SOPS + age**: Modern encrypted secrets management
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent experience across macOS, Linux, WSL

**Why**: Modern development requires more sophisticated environment management than traditional dotfiles provide.

### 3. Tokyo Night Theme Consistency

**Goal**: Provide a unified, professional dark theme across all development tools.

**Implementation**:
- **Unified color palette**: Single source of truth for all colors
- **Application coverage**: Theme applied to terminal, editor, shell, system monitor, etc.
- **Theme switching**: Easy switching between variants when available

**Why**: Visual consistency reduces cognitive load and creates a more professional development environment.

### 4. Zero-Config Experience

**Goal**: Provide a working development environment immediately after installation with minimal user configuration required.

**Implementation**:
- **One-line bootstrap**: Complete setup with single command
- **Sensible defaults**: Working configuration out of the box
- **Optional customization**: Easy to customize, but not required
- **Health checking**: Automated verification of setup

**Why**: Reduce time to productivity and make the system accessible to developers of all experience levels.

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity Over Complexity

**Principle**: Choose simple solutions that solve 80% of problems rather than complex solutions that solve 100%.

**Examples**:
- Use LazyVim instead of custom Neovim config
- Prefer shell aliases over complex scripts
- Trust tool defaults over extensive customization

**Rationale**: Simple systems are easier to understand, maintain, and debug. They're also more likely to continue working as dependencies change.

### 2. XDG-First, Legacy-Compatible

**Principle**: Use modern XDG Base Directory specification while maintaining compatibility with legacy tools.

**Examples**:
- Configs in `~/.config/<tool>/` with shims in `~/.<tool>rc`
- Respect XDG environment variables
- Clean separation of config, data, and cache

**Rationale**: Modern file organization improves system cleanliness while legacy shims ensure compatibility.

### 3. Security by Default

**Principle**: Implement secure practices by default rather than as an afterthought.

**Examples**:
- Encrypted secrets management built-in
- Proper file permissions set automatically
- No secrets in version control
- Secure key generation and storage

**Rationale**: Security should be easy to do correctly and hard to do wrong.

### 4. Cross-Platform Consistency

**Principle**: Provide identical functionality and experience across all supported platforms.

**Examples**:
- Homebrew for all platforms (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- Platform-specific aliases that provide consistent interfaces
- Same tools available everywhere

**Rationale**: Developers work on multiple platforms and should have consistent tools and workflows.

### 5. Team-Friendly

**Principle**: Support team collaboration and sharing while allowing individual customization.

**Examples**:
- Version-controlled `.envrc` files for project environments
- SOPS for team secret sharing
- Fork-friendly architecture
- Local override capabilities

**Rationale**: Development is often collaborative, and tools should support team workflows.

## Design Philosophy

### Inspired by Omarchy

**What We Adopted**:
- Minimal configuration philosophy
- Trust in tool defaults
- Performance-focused approach
- Essential functionality only
- Clean, readable configs

**What We Extended**:
- Added modern development workflow support
- Implemented cross-platform compatibility
- Added encrypted secrets management
- Provided team collaboration features

**What We Avoided**:
- Complex custom configurations
- Tool-specific optimizations that break portability
- Features that duplicate tool functionality
- Extensive customization that obscures defaults

### Modern Additions

**Justified Extensions**:
1. **Direnv**: Essential for modern project-based development
2. **Git directory switching**: Critical for work/personal separation
3. **SOPS secrets**: Required for secure credential management
4. **Cross-platform support**: Necessary for modern development teams

**Criteria for Additions**:
- Solves a real, common problem
- Doesn't duplicate existing tool functionality
- Maintains simplicity and focus
- Supports team collaboration
- Works reliably across platforms

## Success Metrics

### 1. Time to Productivity

**Goal**: New user productive within 5 minutes of installation
**Measurement**: Time from clone to working development environment
**Target**: < 5 minutes on modern hardware with good internet

### 2. Maintenance Overhead

**Goal**: Minimal ongoing maintenance required
**Measurement**: Time spent on dotfiles maintenance per month
**Target**: < 30 minutes per month for updates and tweaks

### 3. Learning Curve

**Goal**: Easy for beginners, powerful for experts
**Measurement**: Time to understand and customize core functionality
**Target**: Basic customization possible within 1 hour of setup

### 4. Reliability

**Goal**: Consistent operation across all supported platforms
**Measurement**: Success rate of bootstrap process
**Target**: > 95% success rate on supported platforms

### 5. Performance

**Goal**: Minimal impact on shell startup and system performance
**Measurement**: Shell startup time and resource usage
**Target**: < 200ms shell startup time

## Non-Goals

### What This System Does NOT Aim to Provide

1. **Complete Desktop Environment**: Focus is on terminal-based development tools
2. **Every Possible Tool**: Only essential, widely-used tools are included
3. **Extensive Customization**: Prefer tool defaults over custom configurations
4. **GUI Application Configs**: Terminal and command-line tools only
5. **Language-Specific IDEs**: General-purpose editor (Neovim) only
6. **Window Manager Configs**: Terminal-based workflow focus
7. **System Administration**: Personal development environment only

### Conscious Limitations

1. **Tool Selection**: Conservative approach to avoid configuration drift
2. **Platform Support**: Focus on common development platforms only
3. **Customization Depth**: Prefer shallow, maintainable customizations
4. **Feature Completeness**: 80/20 rule - cover common use cases well

## Philosophy in Practice

### Decision Framework

When considering additions or changes, ask:

1. **Does it align with Omarchy's minimalism?**
2. **Does it solve a real, common problem?**
3. **Can it be implemented simply?**
4. **Does it work across all platforms?**
5. **Does it support team collaboration?**
6. **Will it be maintainable long-term?**

If the answer to any question is "no", the change should be reconsidered or simplified.

### Evolution Strategy

**Continuous Improvement**:
- Regular review of included tools for relevance
- Simplification over feature addition
- User feedback integration
- Performance optimization
- Security updates

**Controlled Growth**:
- New tools must meet high bar for inclusion
- Prefer configuration of existing tools over new tools
- Maintain backwards compatibility
- Document all changes and rationale
